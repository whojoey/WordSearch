CS 146 

Created a word finder for a word search for a CS 146 that can be of any length in multiple directions (forward, back, 
left, right, all diagonal). It uses a 2D Arraylist(nested ArrayList) and ArrayList of Strings to store the characters in Java. 
The code pulls the search from a input.txt file through a Buffered Reader. It also uses Maps to store the words located 
in multiple locations. It only works for txt file formatted a certain way such as:

a b c d e f g h <br>
a b c d e f g h <br>
a b c d e f g h <br>
a b c d e f g h <br>
a b c d e f g h <br> 

abcd efgh aaaaa bbbbb cdef hgfe
